## Creating your own Custom Action

### Github's way

[https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions)

## Better way

Write the scripts in whatever programming lanuage you like. 
Execute the scripts natively on the runner or inside docker. 
This way the scripts are not coupled to Github Actions.
